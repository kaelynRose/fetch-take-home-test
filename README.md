## Running Locally

There are a few things you will need if you are to run this locally.

- A code editor of your choice
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) version 20.9.0
- NPM Package Manager
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9
- [Geolib NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geolib)

### Installs

Check out these guides for installing the following tools:
- [Node.js and NPM](https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli)
- [Geolib NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geolib)

### Clone The Repository

Once you've installed everything, you'll want to clone the repository to your local machine. Since this can vary by machine and code editor, it will be assumed that you already know how to do this, or are able to look it up online.

### Development server

Navigate to where you cloned the repository using a command line interface/terminal of your choosing.

Run `npm install` to install the proper node packages that the application will need.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
You can also use the command `ng serve --open` to run a dev server and open the application at the same time.
